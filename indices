With do values the counter takes the value of each array element in turn:

!Pump[1] = 'Fred'
!Pump[20] = 'Tom'
!Pump[10] = 'Jim'
do !Name values !Pump
Sp array element is $!Name
enddo

This will produce the following output:

Array Element is Fred
Array Element is Jim
Array Element is Tom

On exit from a do values loop PML destroys the loop counter variable.

With do indices the counter takes the value of each array subscript at which an array element is stored:

!Pump[1] = 'Fred'
!Pump[20] = 'Tom'
!Pump[10] = 'Jim'
do !IN indices !Pump
 !Value = !Pump[!IN]
SP Array Element $!N is $!Value
enddo

This will produce the following output:

Array Element 1 is Fred
Array Element 10 is Jim
Array Element 20 is Tom
